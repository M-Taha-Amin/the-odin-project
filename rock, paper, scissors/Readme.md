This project contains functional implementation of classic game, 'rock, paper, scissors'

(Note: I have not added the UI yet, because I do not know DOM so please play it using console)

- It lets user input their choice
- Then gets a random choice from computer
- Compares with the user to see the winner
- And finally, the one with 5 wins first, wins!

Hope you like it!
