          <h3>What is Chicken korma?</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>Korma</b> is a cherished South Asian dish with Mughlai origins.
            The word <em>‘korma‘</em> (or <em>qorma</em>) means ‘to braise’, or
            pan-sear. In the Pakistani and North Indian way of preparation,
            chicken is sautéed in ghee/oil and whole spices before a blend of
            yogurt and fried onions is added to produce a rich curry.

          <h3>PREPARATION</h3>
          <br />
          <hr />
          <ol>
            <li>
              Heat the oil/ghee in a deep pot or pan. Add the sliced onions and
              fry them over a medium to high heat, stirring often and keeping a
              very close eye on them to ensure they brown evenly. You may find
              you need to turn the heat down after a while if they look like
              they may be browning too quickly/unevenly.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once the onions have turned a dark brown (not black!), use a
              slotted spoon to remove them and rest them spread out on a paper
              towel. Set aside - these will crisp up as we work on the korma
            </li>
            <li>
              Add the chicken, spices, ginger and garlic to the oil in the pan.
              Fry this over a medium to high heat, until the chicken no longer
              remains pink
            </li>
            <li>
              Add in the yogurt and cashews paste. Fry everything well, stirring
              the entire time, until the oil begins to separate from the sauce
              of the curry and looks glossy.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add in 400ml of water, bring everything to a boil and then cover
              with a lid and cook on a low heat for about 30 minutes
            </li>
            <li>
              As the korma cooks, once the onions have cooled down completely
              and become crisp, you can crush them using your hands or a pestle
              and mortar until they are broken down into a textured mixture.
              Don't crush them into a fine powder or paste.
            </li>
            <li>
              Take the lid off and stir in the onions. Return the lid and cook
              for a further 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add in the kewra water. Give everything a taste and adjust the
              chilli and salt if needed
            </li>
            <li>Garnish with almonds just before serving</li>
          </ol>
