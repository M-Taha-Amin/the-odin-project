          <h3>What is Biryani?</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>Biryani</b> is an intricate rice dish made with layers of curried
            meat and rice. Given its use of adornments and luxurious finishes,
            it’s no surprise that biryani has roots in Persian cuisine.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>There are two main methods of making biryani:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b><em>Kachi</em> (raw) biryani</b>, made with raw meat and
              parboiled rice and cooked together, and
            </li>
            <li>
              <b><em>Pakki</em> (cooked) biryani</b>, in which cooked meat and
              parboiled rice are steamed together.
